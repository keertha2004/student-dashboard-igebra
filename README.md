# Student Dashboard - Igebra.ai Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a **Next.js dashboard** built to visualize and analyze a synthetic student dataset. It provides insights into students’ cognitive skills, assessment scores, and engagement patterns.

**Features:**
- **Overview Stats:** Average scores and skills of students.  
- **Charts:**
  - **Bar Chart:** Skill vs Assessment Score  
  - **Scatter Chart:** Attention vs Performance  
  - **Radar Chart:** Individual student profiles  
- **Student Table:** Searchable, sortable, and scrollable table of student data  
- **Insights Section:** Key findings and ML model metrics (MSE & R²)  

---

## Dataset
Synthetic dataset `students_processed.json` contains the following fields:  
`student_id`, `name`, `class`, `comprehension`, `attention`, `focus`, `retention`, `assessment_score`, `engagement_time`.

---

## Analysis & Machine Learning
- Correlation analysis between cognitive skills and assessment scores.
- Simple **ML model** (e.g., Linear Regression) predicting `assessment_score`.
- Students clustered into learning personas to identify performance patterns.

All analysis and model training are in the Jupyter Notebook provided.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run locally:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on **Vercel**:
[https://your-vercel-link.vercel.app](https://your-vercel-link.vercel.app)

Vercel automatically builds and updates the dashboard whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Insights & Findings

* Top performing clusters have higher comprehension and attention.
* Students with low retention often need additional support.
* Engagement time correlates moderately with assessment scores.
* ML Model Metrics:

  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 32.98
  * **R² Score:** 0.44
